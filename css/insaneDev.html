    <h2>Open SSL</h2>
    <p><em>OpenSSL</em> is a general purpose cryptography library that provides an open source implementation of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols.The library includes tools for generating RSA private keys and Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs), checksums, managing certificates and performing encryption/decryption. OpenSSL is written in C, but wrappers are available for a wide variety of computer languages.As of this writing, itâ€™s estimated that 66% of all Web servers use OpenSSL. The OpenSSL toolkit is licensed under an Apache-style license.

    <h2>Data abstraction</h2>
    <p>Abstraction refers to the act of representing essential features without including the
    background details to distinguish objects/ functions from other objects/functions. In
    case of structured programming, functional abstraction was provided by telling,
    which task is performed by function and hiding how that task is performed. A step
    further, in the Object Oriented Programming approach, classes use the concept of data abstraction.
    With data abstraction, data structures can be used without having to be concerned
    about the exact details of implementation. As in case of built-in data types like
    integer, floating point, etc. The programmer only knows about the various operations
    which can be performed on these data types, but how these operations are carried out
    by the hardware or software is hidden from the programmer. Similarly in Object
    Oriented approach, classes act as abstract data types. Classes are defined as a set of
    attributes and functions to operate on these attributes. They encapsulate all the
    essential properties of the objects that are to be created.</p>

    <h2>Inheritance</h2>
    <p>Inheritance is the process by which objects of one class acquire the properties of
    objects of another class in the hierarchy. For example, the scooter is a type of the
    class two-wheelers, which is again a type of (or kind of) the class motor vehicles. As
    shown in the Figure 5 the principle behind it is that the derived class shares common
    characteristics with the class from which it is derived.
    New classes can be built from the existing classes. It means that we can add
    additional features to an existing class without modifying it. The new class is referred
    as derived class or sub class and the original class is known as base class or super
    class. Therefore, the concept of inheritance provides the idea of reusability. This
    inheritance mechanism allows the programmer to reuse a class that is made almost,
    but not exactly, similar to the required one by adding a few more features to it.
    As shown in Figure 5, three classes have been derived from one base class. Feature A
    and Feature B of the base class are inherited in all the three derived classes. Also,
    each derived class has added its own features according to the requirement.
    Therefore, new classes use the concept of reusability and extend their functionality.</p>
